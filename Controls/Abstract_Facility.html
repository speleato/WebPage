    <p class="textPopUp">Supply chains with returned products are receiving increasing at-
    tention in the operations management community. The present paper studies a
    capacitated facility location model with bidirectional flows and marginal value
    of time for returned products. The distribution system consists of a single
    supplier that provides one new product to a set of distribution centers (DCs),
    which then ship to the final retailers. While at the retailers' site, products
    can be shipped back to the supplier for reprocessing. Each DC is capacitated
    and handles stocks of new and/or returned product. The model is a nonlin-
    ear mixed-integer program that optimizes DC location and allocation between
    retailers and DCs. We show that it can be converted to a conic quadratic
    program which can be efficiently solved. Some valid inequalities are added to
    the program to improve computational efficiency. We conclude by reporting
    numerical experiments that reveal some interesting properties of the model.
